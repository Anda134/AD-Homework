# AD-Homework
In a coastal area teeming with lobsters, a fisherman with a limited-capacity net aims to maximize his catch's value without surpassing the net's size limit. By selecting lobsters based on their size and value, he seeks to optimize his overall catch, ensuring the highest possible return from the abundant marine resources.

To compile and build the application binaries from the provided source code, follow these steps:
1.	Download the Source Code: Ensure you have the source code files (main.c and lobsters.h) available in your local environment.
2.	Set Up Compilation Environment: Make sure you have a C compiler installed on your system. Common options include GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) for Unix-like systems or MinGW for Windows.
3.	Compile the Code: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the source code files. Then, execute the following command to compile the code:
        gcc main.c -o lobster_application -lm 
This command compiles the main.c file into an executable named lobster_application. The -lm flag links the math library, which may be necessary if mathematical functions are used in the code.
4.	Run the Application: Once the compilation process completes without errors, you can run the application by executing the following command:
         ./lobster_application 
This command runs the compiled application, which will read input data from a file named data.in and write the output to a file named data.out.
5.	View Output: After running the application, you can view the output in the data.out file generated by the program. This file will contain information about the test cases, the total value of gold coins for each test case, and the CPU time used for computation.
